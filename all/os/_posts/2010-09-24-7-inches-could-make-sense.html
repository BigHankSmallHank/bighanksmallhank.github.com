<p>Dear John Gruber,</p>

<p>You say a 7-inch iPad doesn't sound right and I agree. However I started running some numbers and found a way is how it could make sense though.</p>

<p>Retina Display means different things to different people.  To some it is 325 pixels per inch, to others it is 4x the amount of pixels. My interpretation is a screen whose resolution exceeds or matches my eyes resolving power at normal viewing distance. My iPhone 4 provides that to me from about 12 and farther. According to <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/06/10/resolving-the-iphone-resolution/">Phil Plait's article Resolving the iPhone resolution</a>.</p>

<p>Let's say Apple created an iPad with a 7-inch (diagonal) screen but kept the resolution the same 1024x768. Its pixel density would increase from 132 ppi to 183 ppi. The pixels would be 0.00547 inches large. What is the normal viewing distance for an iPad? 12 inches like the iPhone seems a little close&emdash;Probably between 18 and 24 inches. Turns out the resolving power of our eyes allow us to distinguish objects of size 0.005236 from 18 inches and 0.00698 from 24 inches. So a 7-inch iPad has a retina display if normal viewing distance is 18 inches.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem like Apple would shrink the iPad just to make the display sharper but if they did shrink it to 7-inches I could see how they could claim it to have a Retina Display. The touch targets in all apps would all shrink: not going to happen.</p>

<p>Your Friend,</p>
