p. I have multiple computers and an iPhone.  I use Apple Mail and I want all my email to be synchronized.  I don't want to read the same message twice.  My primary account is a gmail account but I have a few other accounts at spokt.com.  The secret to this simple hack is to use wrap your pop mailbox with a gmail account and enable IMAP.

h3. Step 1: Create Gmail account.

p. Invite your POP account to gmail (or open a new account from scratch)  If you address is bill@lambier.com you could set up bill_lambier@gmail.com

h3. Step 2: Configure Gmail Ready

* Log into gmail account and do the following under "Settings":
* Forwarding and POP/IMAP - click "Enable IMAP" and "Save Changes"
* Change to the "Accounts and Import" tab then "Add POP3 email account"
* Enter your POP3 account info

h3. Step 3: Setup Account in Mail

* In Mail open preferences (Cmd+,).
* Click Accounts
* Click the + in the lower-left corner
* Enter your gmail address (bill_lambier@gmail.com) and password

You can repeat step 3 on all your devices and you mail will be synchronized.  Plus you can log into the gmail web interface which is good too.  Simple hack, simple pleasures.
